# CySecApp 1004

This is a security Dashboard that I'm making for my COMP1004 Module. It's a single page web application, which displays data about how many users connect to the systems, system statuses and health, security alerts and system alerts.

It uses:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
* C# ASP.NET Backend to store data digitally e.g. history, logins
* JSON arrays or .CSV files to store data for graphs
* Chart.js to display graphs
* Bootstrap Lux for the Graphics/ Visuals
* Photoshop for graphics
